#' PPMCA: A Shiny web application to analyze species data in spatial and temporal scales and for changepoint analysis
#'
#' The PPMCA package runs a Shiny web application that allows to
#' visualize spatial and temporal species data, estimate significant factors and identify the significant changes in abundance level.
#' The application allows to fit Bayesian zero inflation joint models to obtain significant estimates and their uncertainty
#' by using R-INLA, and to detect changepoints by using four different Bayesian changepoint techniques.
#' The application allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations
#' such as maps supporting padding and zooming and tables that allow for filtering.
